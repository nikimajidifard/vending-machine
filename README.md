# vending-machine
VHDL code to implement a vending machine.
It's about the vending machine that sells a special drink and each of them costs $2. Our currencies are only $1, $2 and $5.
This machine has been designed in such a way that when it receives enough money, it will give the drink, also if
if the amount of money is more than the amount of the drink, the rest of the money will be returned to us.

Moore state machine is as follows:
